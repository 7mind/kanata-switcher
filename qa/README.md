# QA Checklists

This folder tracks human QA status for user-facing features. Update the relevant checklist(s)
whenever manual testing is performed.

Each checklist includes:
- Preconditions and setup
- Step-by-step actions
- Expected results
- A "Last tested" line for quick status

Suggested process:
- Duplicate or edit the checklist file per release
- Record environment details (DE, version, compositor, distro)
- Note deviations or failures with short logs
